A handful of companies own a sizable chunk of early childhood education centers in New Zealand, according to a BusinessDesk analysis of ECE data and business records. BestStart Educare Limited is the largest ECE proprietor, with at least 18,110 licensed spots. That is more than double the amount of licensed spots available to the next two largest groups. Evolve Education Group Limited has at least 6,717 licensed spots and Busy Bees has 6,466. 

There are seven companies that commandeer at least 1,000 licensed childcare places and 17 companies with at least 500 licensed places for students. That includes both daycares and homebased care networks. Almost all of the businesses receive government funding to provide 20 hours of free education. 

Since 2021, seven of the 16 largest ECE ownership groups identified by NZEI have grown the number of licensed spots they are in charge of. Busy Bees NZ Bidco Limited, traceable through the Provincial Education Group, added hundreds of licensed availability. They had the most growth, but it is possible that the others had changed their corporate structure or no longer controlled the companies in name. BestStart grew their licensed spots by 134 since 2021. Evolve lost hundreds of spots traceable to them. 

In 27 instances, ECE owners enrolled at least one more student than they were licensed for. Happy Tots Limited allegedly had 340 students enrolled as of July 2023 despite not being licensed for anyone. 


ABOUT THE DATA:

BusinessDesk created a database to add depth to the ECE directory published by the Ministry of Education. A data journalist spent weeks identifying the ownership and funding of childcare centers throughout New Zealand by parsing through business rolls, real estate records and company websites. 

The focus was identifying further information on management teams with the largest portfolios and thus the data is not a full reckoning of ownership of all ECE centers.The data is current as of 19 April 2024 with enrollment figures updated as of 1 July 2023. Connecting ECE centers was as comprehensive as possible with the time and resources available with verifiable address and management associations.
